/*
 * The python type caster for polymorphic types can only lookup exact
 * matches. I.e. if we have a property Basis that derives from CompositeProperty
 * which derives from Property, and we try to cast a Property pointer pointing to a Basis
 * and only Property and CompositeProperty are exposed to python and not Basis. Python will
 * not find a exact match, and the returned wrapper will be of the Pointer class used.
 * In this cases Property. To get at least some support for unexposed properties
 * derived from CompositeProperty and BaseOptionProperty we add a specialization here
 * that will mean that in the example above we will get a CompositeProperty wrapper instead of
 * of a Property wrapper.
 * see polymorphic_type_hook at the end of include/pybind11/detail/type_caster_base.h
